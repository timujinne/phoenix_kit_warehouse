# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-08-22

### Added

- **Item adding on internal orders, stocktakes, and transfers now goes
  through the catalogue's `ItemSelectorModal`** (#23). The warehouse-local
  `add_picker/1` (tree/search/add UI that never touched a stock-specific
  field) is gone. Confirming a selection seeds each new line with the
  picked quantity instead of always starting at zero; re-adding an
  already-present item is still a no-op.

### Changed

- **⚠️ Requires `phoenix_kit_catalogue ~> 0.18`.** `ItemSelectorModal`
  first shipped in catalogue 0.18.0. The previous `~> 0.13` pin would
  still resolve 0.13–0.17, which this package cannot compile against.
  Locked in with `test/catalogue_pin_conformance_test.exs`.
- **Documentation now matches the actual dependency contract.** The
  `PhoenixKitWarehouse` moduledoc claimed `PhoenixKitComments` "stays optional
  (guarded via `Code.ensure_loaded?/1`)", and `AGENTS.md` said the same. Neither
  was true: `phoenix_kit_comments` is not declared `optional:` in `mix.exs`, and
  six form LiveViews `use PhoenixKitComments.Embed`, which is macro expansion at
  compile time and cannot be guarded. All four sibling packages are now
  described as hard dependencies, with the distinction a reader actually needs
  spelled out — a hard *package* dependency is not a required *module*, and
  `required_modules/0` lists only `"catalogue"` and `"locations"`. The moduledoc
  also no longer implies billing is enablement-checked; it isn't, its component
  is imported unconditionally.
- `PhoenixKitWarehouse.Comments`' moduledoc now states what "unavailable" covers
  (installed-but-disabled) and what it does not (version skew — `available?/0`
  returns `true` against comments 0.2.6/0.2.7, where `subscribe/2` and the batch
  `count_comments/2` do not yet exist; the `>= 0.2.8` floor is what closes that,
  not any guard in the module). The `Code.ensure_loaded?/1` check and the
  `@compile {:no_warn_undefined, ...}` attribute are labelled as the always-true
  residue they are.
- Dependency updates (`phoenix_kit` 2.13.6, `phoenix_kit_catalogue` 0.18.0,
  `rustler` 0.38.0).

### Fixed

- **`mdex_native` force-builds under `MDEX_NATIVE_BUILD=1`** (#20). Declares
  `rustler` as an optional Hex dep, matching `phoenix_kit`'s own `mix.exs`,
  so a clean checkout of this repo can compile the NIF from source on OTP
  28 (no precompiled artefact). A host application still has to declare
  `rustler` itself — optional deps of deps are never resolved.
- **Supplier names on goods receipts and supplier orders resolve through
  CRM when the local row is linked** (#21). `Catalogue.resolve_supplier/1`
  replaces `get_supplier/1` on the two form LiveViews, so a
  `crm_company_uuid` link shows the party's current name instead of the
  local snapshot. Post-merge: the two *index* LiveViews had the same stale
  snapshot (they used `list_suppliers/0`); both now call
  `resolve_suppliers/1`.
- **Eight top-level admin tabs set `visible: true` explicitly** (#22).
  Core 2.6.0 made an unset `Tab.visible` mean "auto" (`nil`), and this
  module's own test was reading the raw field, so the 8 nav tabs looked
  hidden to the suite. The rendered sidebar was never affected. Also
  corrects the hardcoded tab count 37 → 38 (Turnover).
- **ItemSelectorModal host wiring** (review of #23): already-counted
  stocktake lines round-tripped through JSONB as strings were dropped from
  the modal's `selected` map (Decimal-only match), so they looked pickable
  again; all three LiveViews now coerce through `StockLedger.to_decimal/1`.
  Scope is `%{statuses: ["active"]}` (warehouse never stocks inactive
  items). Locale and `qty_precision: 6` are passed through so the modal
  matches the warehouse `@locale` and `step="any"` quantity inputs. A
  pick whose catalogue row is gone is skipped instead of crashing the
  LiveView via `get_item!/1`.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **Permission-matrix and admin-tab labels stay translated regardless of
  unrelated wording changes elsewhere** (#18). Pins all eight admin-tab
  labels and the `permission_metadata/0` label/description as gettext
  msgids via a new `translatable_labels/0`, so they no longer depend on
  `Web.WarehouseHeader`/`Web.TurnoverReportLive` happening to use the same
  English strings. Before this, rewording either file would have silently
  reverted eight admin tabs to English with no compile error and no failing
  test — locked in with new test coverage.

### Changed

- Dependency updates (`phoenix_kit` 2.8.0, `phoenix_kit_catalogue` 0.16.1,
  `ecto` 3.14.2, `grpc`/`grpc_core` 1.0.4, `beamlab_countries` 1.2.0,
  `etcher` 0.12.1, `quic` 1.8.1).

## 0.3.1 - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **`priv/` is now shipped in the Hex package** (#17). It was missing from the
  `files:` list, so `priv/gettext` never reached anyone installing from Hex and
  every string rendered as its English msgid no matter what locale the host was
  in. The translations were only ever working for people running from a
  checkout of this repo.

### Changed

- Dependency updates (`phoenix_kit` 2.2.0, `phoenix_kit_catalogue` 0.14.0,
  `phoenix_kit_comments` 0.4.0, `phoenix_kit_locations` 0.4.1, `phoenix`
  1.8.10, `hackney` 4.7.3).

## 0.3.0 - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **⚠️ Requires `phoenix_kit ~> 2.0`.** The core pin moved to `~> 2.0`, so this
  release no longer resolves against core 1.7.

  Core 2.0.0 squashes the migration chain into a single `V135` baseline and makes
  V135 the chain's floor: `mix ecto.migrate` now *refuses* on a database below it
  rather than migrating. Check `mix phoenix_kit.status` **before** upgrading. A
  host below V135 must install `phoenix_kit 1.7.236` — the migration bridge, the
  last release carrying the full pre-squash chain — migrate until the reported
  version is at least V135, and only then move to 2.0.

  This package does not call migration internals, so the change is the pin
  itself.

- Sibling pins raised in step, each to that package's first release requiring
  core 2.0: `phoenix_kit_billing` → `~> 0.7`, `phoenix_kit_catalogue` → `~> 0.13`,
  `phoenix_kit_comments` → `~> 0.3`, `phoenix_kit_locations` → `~> 0.4`.
  `phoenix_kit_comments` 0.3.0 is a **security release** (stored XSS in comment
  bodies); see its CHANGELOG.

### Changed

- **Stops calling the deprecated `Scope.admin?/1` (PR #13).** Core renamed it to
  `can_access_admin_area?/1` in 1.7.214 and kept the old name as a
  `@deprecated` delegate, so this is a pure rename with no behaviour change — it
  silences a deprecation warning host apps were eating on every compile with no
  way to fix it themselves.

### Added

- **Gettext keys in `permission_metadata` (PR #14)** so the permissions-matrix
  rows render translated labels instead of falling back to a raw key, plus a
  test pinning the metadata shape — a missing key degrades silently into an
  untranslated label rather than an error.

## 0.2.7 - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **Dependency floor raised to `phoenix_kit ~> 1.7.231`** (PR #12, from
  `~> 1.7.214`) — seven index LiveViews `use PhoenixKitWeb.Live.UrlState`, which
  first shipped in core 1.7.231. The old requirement declared a contract that
  permitted a core without that module, so a consumer whose resolution landed
  below 1.7.231 would fail to compile this package. `mix.lock` already carried
  1.7.231, so this corrects the published contract, not the current build.
- **Dependency floor raised to `phoenix_kit_comments ~> 0.2 and >= 0.2.8`**
  (post-merge review of PR #12, from `~> 0.2`) — the same class of defect PR #12
  fixed for core, left in place three lines below it. Six form LiveViews `use
  PhoenixKitComments.Embed`, which first shipped in comments 0.2.6; a `use` is
  macro expansion at compile time and cannot be guarded. `PhoenixKitWarehouse.
  Comments` additionally calls `subscribe/2`, `unsubscribe/2` and the list form
  of `count_comments/2`, all three of which arrived in 0.2.8 — and its
  `available?/0` guard only covers `PhoenixKitComments` being absent entirely,
  not an older release that is present but missing those functions. The ceiling
  stays `< 1.0.0` rather than becoming `~> 0.2.8`'s `< 0.3.0`, so a future
  comments 0.3.0 still resolves.
- **The `—` placeholder never appeared in the read-only price and sum cells of
  the inventory count sheet.** They rendered `format_input_decimal(value) ||
  "—"`, but `format_input_decimal/1` returns `""` — never `nil` — for a missing
  value, and `""` is truthy, so the cell went blank instead. Now goes through an
  explicit `blank_to_dash/1`.

### Changed

- **`mix precommit` passes for the first time.** It had been failing on `main`
  for a long time, on findings spread across the whole codebase rather than any
  recent change. Cleared all 291 `mix credo --strict` issues (248
  `Design.AliasUsage`, 37 `Readability.AliasOrder`, 2 `WithSingleClause`, plus
  `PreferImplicitTry`, `StringSigils`, `CyclomaticComplexity` and `Nesting`) and
  all four actionable dialyzer warnings.
- `SupplierOrders.import_from_internal_orders/3` is split into
  `load_posted_internal_orders/1`, `load_items_by_uuid/1`,
  `collect_import_lines/2`, `import_line/6`, `sole_supplier?/2` and
  `merge_import_lines/2` — behaviour preserved exactly, cyclomatic complexity 16
  → under the limit and nesting depth 5 → 3.
- `StorageFolders` drops the `parent_uuid` parameter that both call sites always
  passed as `nil`; the folder lookup is now explicitly root-scoped. Dead
  `pick_name/1` fallback clauses removed from `Inventories` and
  `Web.Components.WarehouseBrowser` — `safe_get_translation/2` already rescues
  to `%{}`, which is the real defensive layer.
- New `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` documents the six `Ecto.Multi` opaqueness warnings
  (one per context's `lock_status_step/3`), which are an artefact of Ecto's
  `@opaque t()` and have no code-level fix. Wired up with
  `list_unused_filters: true` so a stale filter is reported.

## 0.2.6 - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **Warehouse list search and sort now live in the URL** (PR #11) — all seven
  index screens (`stock`, `inventories`, `internal_orders`, `supplier_orders`,
  `goods_receipts`, `goods_issues`, `transfers`) adopt core's
  `PhoenixKitWeb.Live.UrlState` in `:patch` mode, exposing `?q=`, `?sort=` and
  `?dir=`. A filtered list is now a real URL: shareable, reload-proof, and Back
  returns to the previous query instead of leaving the page. List loading moves
  from `handle_params/3` to the `handle_url_state/2` callback, so one code path
  serves the first render, a shared link and the Back button. The debounced
  search box patches with `replace: true`, leaving one history entry rather
  than one per pause in typing. `stock_view` and `warehouse_scope` stay
  per-user `ViewConfig` preferences and are deliberately **not** in the URL.
- `StockLive` caches its ledger snapshot per mount behind an explicit
  `:stock_items_loaded?` flag, so search and sort re-slice the loaded list
  instead of re-running `Deficits.available_by_item/0`, the min-stock map and
  the Catalogue load on every keystroke.

### Fixed

- **Hiding the active sort column could leave the list stale** — when a column
  save hid the column being sorted by, `__view_config_changed__/1` re-picked
  `List.first(selected_columns)`, which is the first *visible* column and need
  not be **sortable** (`sub_order`, `supplier_order`, `location`,
  `source_location`, `destination_location` never are, and column order is
  user-controlled). `push_url_state/3` sanitizes anything outside the declared
  `in:` whitelist back to the default, so the re-pick silently collapsed to
  `"number"` / `"item"` — and when that was already the active sort, the URL
  state did not move at all, `handle_url_state/2` never re-ran, and the column
  or filter change that triggered it was never applied to the table. All seven
  screens now pick the first visible column that is actually sortable and
  refresh in place when the re-pick resolves to the current column.
- `mix.lock` carried eight unused entries (`igniter`, `sourceror`, `spitfire`,
  `rewrite`, `owl`, `text_diff`, `ex_ast`, `glob_ex`) left over from the
  dependency bump in 0.2.5, which `mix deps.unlock --check-unused` rejects.

### Testing

- New DB-less unit test pins each index LiveView's `?sort=` whitelist to the
  `sortable?: true` columns of its `ColumnConfig` — the two are the same fact
  written twice, and drift is silent: a sortable column left out of the
  whitelist cannot be sorted by at all. Also asserts each declared default sort
  column is itself sortable and that `?dir=` stays `cast: :atom` restricted to
  `[:asc, :desc]`.

## 0.2.5 - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- **Stop calling the deprecated `PhoenixKit.Users.Auth.Scope.admin?/1`.** All 7
  call sites — one per form/stock LiveView (`stock_live`,
  `goods_receipt_form_live`, `goods_issue_form_live`,
  `internal_order_form_live`, `transfer_form_live`,
  `supplier_order_form_live`, `inventory_form_live`) — now call
  `Scope.can_access_admin_area?/1`, the name core renamed it to in phoenix_kit
  1.7.214. The old name is a pure `@deprecated` delegate, so **no behavior
  change** — this only silences the deprecation warning host apps were eating
  on every compile of this library, with no way to fix it themselves. The
  `test/support/live_case.ex` doc comment was updated to match.
- **Dependency floor raised to `phoenix_kit ~> 1.7.214`** (from `~> 1.7.190`) —
  `can_access_admin_area?/1` does not exist below it, so an older core would be
  an `UndefinedFunctionError` at call time rather than a warning. This was not
  hypothetical: the lockfile was resolving 1.7.205.
- Dependency lockfile bumps: `phoenix_kit` 1.7.205 → 1.7.216, `phoenix_kit_ai`
  0.16.0 → 0.17.1, `phoenix_kit_catalogue` 0.12.1 → 0.12.3,
  `phoenix_kit_comments` 0.2.14 → 0.2.15, `phoenix_live_view` 1.2.7 → 1.2.8,
  `etcher` 0.8.1 → 0.9.0, `ex_ast` 0.12.10 → 0.13.1, `bandit` 1.12.0 → 1.12.4,
  `grpc`/`grpc_core` 1.0.2 → 1.0.3, `igniter` 0.8.2 → 0.8.3, `leaf` 0.3.0 →
  0.3.2, `plug_crypto` 2.1.1 → 2.2.0, `glob_ex` 0.1.11 → 0.1.12.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **Row-link overlay escaped its row on Safari/iPad** (PR #10) — Safari
  doesn't honor `position: relative` on `<tr>`, so the whole-row-clickable
  `::after` overlay on every index table (goods issues, goods receipts,
  internal orders, supplier orders, stocktakes, transfers) escaped to the
  `<table>`'s containing block; every row's overlay covered the entire
  table and the last row won hit-testing, so any row tap on iOS/iPadOS
  navigated to the last item. Fixed by adding Tailwind's `transform-gpu`
  utility alongside the existing `relative` class on each row — WebKit does
  honor a `transform` as a containing block on table rows. Reviewed: no
  affected file was missed, and the fix doesn't interact badly with the
  per-row `⋮` action menu (which portals to `<body>` on open) or any
  pinned/sticky table variant.

### Changed (review of PR #9)

- **`permission_metadata/0`'s attempted gettext declaration was reverted**
  — PR #9 added `gettext_backend`/`gettext_domain` to the warehouse's
  `permission_metadata/0`, intending to translate its label in the admin
  permissions matrix the same way `admin_tabs/0` already translates sidebar
  labels. Against the dependency actually pinned in `mix.lock`
  (`phoenix_kit` 1.7.205, published 2026-07-19, before core's
  `localized_module_label/1` work landed), no code reads those two keys —
  the permissions matrix still renders through the plain, untranslated
  `Permissions.module_label/1` — so the addition was inert in production
  and only introduced a new `mix dialyzer` `callback_type_mismatch`
  against the published `permission_meta()` behaviour type. Reverted
  `permission_metadata/0` to its original 4-key shape. Re-adding the two
  keys is the correct follow-up once `phoenix_kit` publishes a Hex release
  containing the localized-permission-labels feature and this repo's pin
  is bumped to it — `admin_tabs/0`'s per-tab gettext declarations are
  unaffected (that feature is real and already published). Full findings:
  `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/9-permission-label-i18n/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`
  and `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/10-safari-row-link/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`.

### Maintenance

- Removed a stale, unused `mix.lock` entry (`beamlab_ex_aws_sqs`, hex
  package v4.0.0) left over from the prior `phoenix_kit` 1.7.199 → 1.7.205
  bump, which renamed the dependency's key to `ex_aws_sqs` (same hex
  package, v5.0.0) and made the old lock entry unreferenced. Caught by
  `mix deps.unlock --check-unused`.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- **`resolve_suppliers/1` gained a guarded junction-primary fallback clause**
  (PR #6), sitting between the `primary_supplier_uuid` scalar check and
  manufacturer resolution: a `Code.ensure_loaded?`/`function_exported?`-guarded
  call to `PhoenixKitCatalogue.Catalogue.Suppliers.primary_for_item/1` (the
  catalogue V151 junction `is_primary` row), falling back to manufacturer
  resolution (with a warning) when the primary row's supplier isn't locally
  resolvable. The guard is correctly written — no crash risk against a
  dependency that doesn't export the function.

### Fixed (review of PR #6)

- **Neither `resolve_suppliers/1` non-manufacturer clause is actually reachable
  against the currently pinned `phoenix_kit_catalogue ~> 0.10` dependency** —
  corrected during review, not a new bug from this PR. `phoenix_kit_catalogue`
  0.10.0 (still Hex's latest as of this release) never shipped
  `primary_supplier_uuid` *or* `Suppliers.primary_for_item/1`: both were added
  and (in the scalar's case) removed entirely in catalogue commits *after*
  0.10.0 was tagged, and remain unpublished. This also means the 0.2.2
  changelog entry below and PR #5's review overstated the scalar's status —
  it was never live in any published catalogue release, not just removed by a
  later one. `resolve_suppliers/1` today is functionally equivalent to
  manufacturer-only resolution for every item. Rewrote the misleading code
  comments to state this plainly (with the mechanism activating automatically,
  no code change needed, once catalogue publishes the junction release and
  this repo's `mix.lock` picks it up), and replaced two pre-existing tests
  that asserted unreachable scalar-based behavior (and would have failed
  against the real dependency) with tests that lock in the real,
  currently-shipping fallback behavior. Full findings:
  `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/6-junction-primary-fallback/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`.

### Notes

- **Dependency lockfile advance** (no `mix.exs` constraint change):
  `hackney` 4.5.2 → 4.6.0.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Goods receipt lines can now set stock `unit_value` on posting** (PR #5).
  When a receipt line carries a `"unit_value"` field, posting writes it to
  `phoenix_kit_warehouse_stock.unit_value` for that item/location via
  `StockLedger.receive_quantity/3`'s existing `:unit_value` option (last
  posted receipt wins). Absent/`nil` leaves the existing value untouched.

### Fixed

- **`resolve_suppliers/1` stopped honoring `item.primary_supplier_uuid`** (PR
  #5 fix, applied during review). PR #5 rewrote supplier resolution to prefer
  a `PhoenixKitCatalogue.Catalogue.Suppliers.primary_for_item/1` junction
  lookup, on the premise that core's V149 migration removed the
  `primary_supplier_uuid` scalar. It didn't: V149 is a purely additive
  per-supplier-pricing junction table, and the scalar remains the item's
  documented default supplier. Against the pinned `phoenix_kit_catalogue ~>
  0.10` dependency, `primary_for_item/1` doesn't exist, so the new code
  silently fell through to manufacturer-only resolution — any item that
  relied on `primary_supplier_uuid` (generic/unbranded materials with no
  manufacturer, or breaking a tie between a manufacturer's multiple linked
  suppliers) stopped auto-assigning a supplier during
  `generate_from_internal_order/2`. Reverted `resolve_suppliers/1` to check
  `primary_supplier_uuid` first, manufacturer as fallback — the original
  pre-PR behavior. Full findings:
  `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/5-parties-resolver-unit-value/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **Stale `V143` migration references renumbered to `V144`** (PR #4). When core's
  consolidation PR merged, the migration creating `phoenix_kit_warehouse_transfers`
  and `phoenix_kit_warehouse_min_stock` was renumbered upstream — core's own V143
  slot went to the new-login-security-alerts migration instead. Every `V143`
  reference in this package (`AGENTS.md`, `min_stock_settings.ex` moduledoc,
  `mix.exs` comments) now points to `V144`, and the `phoenix_kit` dependency pin is
  tightened to `~> 1.7.190` (1.7.189 tops out at V142 and does not carry the
  tables).
- **This CHANGELOG's own 0.2.0 entry still referenced `V143`/`>= 1.7.189` after
  PR #4 landed** — corrected post-release as part of reviewing that PR (see
  `dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/4-v144-renumber-and-pin/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-13

Wave 1: multi-warehouse, transfers, deficit control, turnover.

### Added

- **Multi-warehouse stock scope**: per-location stock balances
  (`StockLedger.stock_map_for_location/1`, `get_quantity/2`), a warehouse
  selector on goods receipt/issue/inventory drafts, and a "per warehouse /
  all warehouses" scope toggle on the Stock page (persisted per user).
- **Transfers**: new document type with a draft → in_transit → done
  lifecycle, atomic ship/receive stock postings, and cancellation (draft:
  void; in_transit: reverses the ship posting back to the source
  warehouse).
- **Deficit control**: per-item minimum stock, an available-quantity
  calculation (on-hand minus posted reserves — draft documents don't
  reserve), zero-stock deficits surfaced even with no `Stock` row, and a
  "create supplier order" action from a deficit row.
- **Turnover report**: aggregated in/out/balance per item over a date
  range, optionally scoped to one warehouse; `balance` is documented as
  current on-hand, not a historical balance as of the end date.
- **Related documents**: a shared upstream/downstream linked-documents
  list component on Internal Order / Supplier Order cards.
- `Transfer`/`MinStock` tables now ship in core `phoenix_kit`'s migration
  V144 instead of this package's own migrator (which is retired); this
  package defines schemas only and owns no DDL.

### Fixed

- `StockLedger.stock_map/0`, `Deficits`, `Inventories`, `GoodsReceipts`,
  `GoodsIssues` previous-quantity audit snapshots, and the `SourceKinds`
  link picker in the goods receipt/issue forms were all made
  warehouse-aware or corrected for multi-location stock (see
  [`dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/3-wave-1-multi-warehouse/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`](dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/3-wave-1-multi-warehouse/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md)
  for the full list, plus this release's own post-merge fixes below).
- Post-merge review fixes: `SupplierOrders.generate_from_internal_order/2`
  and `import_from_internal_orders/3` now read on-hand stock from the
  internal order's own warehouse instead of an arbitrary one;
  `TransferFormLive`'s quantity input is now clamped non-negative
  (a negative value could otherwise inflate source-warehouse stock and
  permanently stall the transfer); `TurnoverReportLive` no longer queries
  the database in `mount/3` (was doubling the report query on every page
  load); `Transfer`/`MinStock` schemas now use `PhoenixKit.SchemaPrefix`,
  matching every other table-backed schema in this package.

### Requires

- `phoenix_kit >= 1.7.190` — `Transfer`/`MinStock` tables ship in core
  migration V144 (renumbered from a provisional V143 before publish;
  1.7.189 tops out at V142, so it does *not* satisfy this pin — corrected
  post-release, see PR #4).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-10

Initial release.

### Added

- **Inventory & stock**: `Stock` balances per item/location, `StockLedger`
  context (upsert/receive/issue with an atomic, non-negative-guarded
  conditional decrement), and stocktakes (`InventoryDocument`) that count
  and post adjustments.
- **Goods receipts & goods issues**: transactional posting (`Ecto.Multi` +
  `FOR UPDATE` compare-and-swap on status) that additively increases
  (receipts) or conditionally decreases (issues) warehouse stock, with a
  per-line `previous_quantity` audit trail.
- **Supplier orders & internal orders**: draft → posted document lifecycle,
  many-to-many traceability via a generic `source_refs` / `SourceKinds`
  registry (host apps can register their own linkable "order" kinds),
  committed-quantity netting to avoid re-ordering already-requested stock.
- **Admin UI**: index + form LiveViews for every document type, a shared
  `ColumnConfig` engine (sortable/filterable/configurable columns, per-user
  view persistence), file attachments via `StorageFolders`, and comments
  via `PhoenixKitComments` (optional — degrades gracefully when absent).
- Activity logging, i18n (en/et/ru), and the `PhoenixKit.Module` admin-tab
  integration (`module_key: "warehouse"`).
- Project scaffold: `mix.exs` (with the `pk_dep/3` helper, `quality` /
  `quality.ci` / `precommit` aliases, and dialyzer config), `config/`,
  `.formatter.exs`, `.credo.exs`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `AGENTS.md`.

### Requires

- `phoenix_kit >= 1.7.182` — the warehouse DB tables ship in core migration
  V140, first published in that core release.

### Known issues

See [`dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/1-warehouse-module/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md`](dev_docs/pull_requests/2026/1-warehouse-module/CLAUDE_REVIEW.md)
for the full review. Notably: stocktake posting can clobber stock movements
that happened between opening the count and posting it (absolute-SET
semantics), and "Generate supplier orders" doesn't record `source_refs`, so
re-importing the same internal order into a second supplier order can
double the ordered quantity. Both need a maintainer decision on intended
semantics before being fixed.

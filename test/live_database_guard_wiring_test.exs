defmodule PhoenixKitWarehouse.LiveDatabaseGuardWiringTest do
  @moduledoc """
  S014: `PhoenixKitWarehouse.Test.LiveDatabaseGuardTest` calls `check!/1`
  directly — it proves the logic is correct, not that `test_helper.exs`
  actually calls it. Deleting the call from `test_helper.exs` leaves that
  test green; it would prove the module still works, not that anything
  still protects a real `mix test` run.

  This test runs `test_helper.exs` for real, as a genuine `mix test`
  subprocess, with `PGDATABASE` set to one of the exact live database
  names the guard exists to refuse. It never lets that subprocess reach a
  real Postgres server, though — `PGHOST` points at an address nothing is
  listening on. That is what makes it safe to name `phoenix_kit_dev`
  literally here: whatever the guard does or doesn't do, no real Postgres
  exists at the address this subprocess is given, so it can never actually
  touch the real database.

  Verified live (mutation, not assumption) that this still tells a correct
  refusal apart from a cut wiring call: with the `check!/1` call commented
  out, the subprocess does NOT fail — `test_helper.exs`'s own existing
  "can't reach the database" fallback (already there for a genuinely
  missing DB) catches the bogus host, prints its own warning, excludes
  `:integration`, and exits 0 normally, since this test file needs no
  database at all. A correct refusal looks categorically different: a
  nonzero exit and the guard's own `LiveDatabaseError` in the output,
  before that fallback ever gets a chance to paper over anything. This
  test asserts exactly that pair (exit code, exception name) rather than
  looking for a connection-failure message that a cut wiring call turns
  out not to produce.

  @moduledoc """
  Guards the `:phoenix_kit` requirement against being re-narrowed to a single
  core MINOR, and against a local path override reaching a commit.

  The trap is the three-segment form: `~> 2.0.x` expands to
  `>= 2.0.x and < 2.1.0`, so no 2.1 or later core satisfies it. The breakage
  lands on CONSUMERS, never here — a host depending on both this module and a
  newer core minor gets an unsolvable dependency set and `mix deps.get` fails
  outright, with no degraded mode. Nothing else in this repo's own test run
  would notice, which is why the check is a test rather than a convention.

  Core 1.7 is deliberately excluded: core 2.0.0 squashed the migration chain to
  a V135 floor and this module is verified only against that baseline.

  A raised FLOOR within 2.x is fine — it is an API the module compiles against
  (2.26.1: `<.decimal_input>` / `Number.parse_decimal/2`), not a ceiling. What
  must never happen is a ceiling below 3.0.
